hello there from space! this is a file that i am writing using our command line text editor! its quite cool actually lol. hopefully this thing is actually usable lol.

i'm using its insert mode at the moment, which is surprisingly nice to use. i think you use <space><newline> to quit insert mode, i think. lets try that out lol.
