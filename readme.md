# a text editor
##### written by Daniel W. R. Rehman.

This is a modal programmable command-line text editor intended for my personal use, based on minimalism, ergonomics and simplicity. It is written in C, and depends only on libc. 
It's features and behavior are loosely based on that of ed and vi.

### Features:

 - minimalist feature set and UI
 - few ergonomic and simple input commands to learn
 - fully configurable key bindings                                    (coming soon)
 - runs fast and is highly memory efficient
 - supports UTF8 unicode
 - uses an undo-tree system
 - copy/paste to global clipboard
 - fully programmable: uses an interpreter for a language I also wrote        (coming soon!)
 - no dependancies besides the C standard library.
 - source code is currently less than 430 lines of code. 
 - other stuff!!! nice.
