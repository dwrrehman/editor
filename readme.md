# My Text Editor.
##### Written By Daniel Warren Riaz Rehman.

This is a simple modal programmable text editor intended for my personal use, based on minimalism, ergonomics and simplicity. 
It's features and behavior are loosely based on that of TextEdit, ed, and vi/vim/kakoune.

### Features:

 - minimalist feature set and ui
 - ergonomic key bindings and display
 - fully configurable key bindings
 - runs fast and is highly memory efficient
 - fully programmable: uses my own interpreter
 - supports UTF8 unicode
 - adjustable soft wrapping of lines 
 - word wrapping 				(coming soon!)
 - adjustable tab stops
 - horizontal and vertical view scrolling
 - togglable line numbers
 - copy/paste to global clipboard
 - uses an undo tree system
 - built-in file tree explorer 
 - highly versatile "\*n buffer" 		(coming soon!)
 - multiple buffers
 - mouse support                                (coming soon!)
 - No dependancies 

### Other notes:

 - source code is currently only 2000ish lines of code. 
 - line numbers are 0-based.
 - no unicode encoding besides UTF8, ever.
 - no syntax highlighting, ever.
 - no mulitple user-file display, ever.
 - VT100 terminal based
