# My Text Editor.
##### Written By Daniel Warren Riaz Rehman.

This is a simple modal text editor intended for my personal use, based on ergonomics and simplicity. 

It's features and behavior are loosely based on that of TextEdit, as well as Vim and Kakoune.


### Features:

 - Fast and efficient

 - No dependancies

 - Supports Unicode UTF8 encoded text.

 - Soft wrapping lines

 - Tab stops

 - Uses an undo tree system


### Other notes:

 - VT100 terminal based

 - No syntax highlighting, ever

 - Built-in file editor coming soon!
