# My Text Editor.
##### Written By Daniel Warren Riaz Rehman.

This is a simple modal text editor intended for my personal use, based on minimalism, ergonomics and simplicity. 

It's features and behavior are loosely based on that of TextEdit, ed, and vi/vim.

### Features:

 - Fast and efficient

 - No dependancies

 - Supports Unicode UTF8 encoded text.

 - Soft wrapping lines

 - Tab stops

 - Uses an undo tree system

 - Togglable line numbers and status bar

 - Copy/paste 

 - Multiple buffers


### Other notes:

 - VT100 terminal based

 - source code is currently only 1400 lines of code. 

 - No syntax highlighting, ever

 - Built-in file editor coming soon!
