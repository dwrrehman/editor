# My Text Editor.
##### Written By Daniel Warren Riaz Rehman.

This is a simple modal text editor intended for my personal use, based on minimalism, ergonomics and simplicity. 
It's features and behavior are loosely based on that of TextEdit, ed, and vi/vim.

### Features:

 - Minimalist, fast and efficient
 - Configurable key bindings
 - Supports the UTF8 unicode encoding only.
 - Soft wrapping lines
 - Tab stops
 - Copy/paste to global clipboard
 - Togglable line numbers and status bar
 - Multiple buffers
 - Uses an undo tree system
 - Programmable: Turing-complete human-readable machine-code for interface.
 - No dependancies 

### Other notes:

 - VT100 terminal based
 - source code is currently only 1459 lines of code. 
 - No syntax highlighting, ever
 - Built-in file editor coming soon!
