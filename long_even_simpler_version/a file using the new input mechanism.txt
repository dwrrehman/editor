hi there!
	this is my cool editor lol. 


i think its actually really cool. i am quite happy with it. 

i think its like basically optimal. pretty much. lol.
funny, i feel like we changed the input mechanism to make the editor shorter, but it totally ended up being wayyyy longer lol.  i mean, thats okay, but like... i wished it was smaller lol.


	but yeah, i mean, i definitely wished it was smaller lol. its okay though. 



yayy
