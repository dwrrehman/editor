okay, lets try doing stuff, now, i think this couldddd work better. not sure though. 


i definitely want to allow the user to relocate the file, and rename it.. those are pretty important to be able to do eventually. but yeah, for now... i don't think we needddd to actually support those lol. we just have to make sure that the filename is always supplied lol. yayyy. 



	okay, cool this actually seems to work well so far!!?


		cool beans lol.


i am happy with this. 


cool pasta. 



lets try writing the file, i guess?


i think its name will default to Untitled.txt   so yeahhh  just like text edit lol.  

	yay


				lets try to do this. 



hopefully it works.
