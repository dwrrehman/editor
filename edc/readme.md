# an Ed-like editor written in C.
##### Written By Daniel Warren Riaz Rehman.

This is a simple modal programmable text editor intended for my personal use, based on minimalism, ergonomics and simplicity. It is written in C11, and depends only on libc. 
It's features and behavior are loosely based on that of ed.

### Features:

 - minimalist feature set and ui
 - no dependancies besides the C standard library.

### Other notes:

 - line numbers are 0-based.
 - no unicode encoding besides UTF8, ever.
