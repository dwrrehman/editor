hello there from space. 




										hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm


	okay, wow i really think this is actually working, now. 


		i hope this actually works!

	

		gosh its been so long since ive ever used my editor, lol.



		so yeah, im pretty excited about this. 


		i think this is like actually a really good editor, honestly!





		i think its doing alot of things right. 




	its just, 

	you know, it lacks a couple of critical features. 



	i think that implementing the undo and redo system, is actually the most complicated thing that im doing, 


		but, i think that simply having the editor have copy-paste multiple buffers,

		is like, totally fine, and stable, probably. 




		heck, the undo and redo system is literally like ALREADY implemented, 
			so its not THAT bad... just takes a bunch of work, 

				kind offfffffffffff




	anyways, just a good test of the editor, this is. 



	i think im going to use it for now on. 


	i love it!




	






			oh my gosh, okay, this actually works!




		im super happy with this!!!





		im so glad this is like actually coming together!


			i think this is really working out, for me.
