			the idea is to rebind the keys in the editor 

		so that you cant accidentily delete the entire file. 

					thats really not going to be allowed. yes you can undo(),   but i dont want to resort to that. ever.



					so the idea is to make           cut()     which uses the anchor    

									to be very hard to press!

										ie, at leastttt a dual char keybind


				anddd



				i want to add a new thing


							which will be callled        cut last


						which uses the  "last" cursor


						which records the lasttt position of the cursor!


							very very very useful. 




		if you move there in one go,   then now we can synethesize stuff 


			super great



						now movement commands are super imporatnt now lol



						i think we need to figure out a way to have more of them



				i want to remove the           ek     keybinding, 



				and also just generally remove alot of the useless ones 



						like   top and bottom, kinda



							we can just use the mode2 for those?    maybe?



								 but yeah, you see now


					


				alsoooo




							i think i kinda want to remove the binding of 



									a



								i want to make that a dead stop actually, i think 



												probably lol



						so yeah


						very useful 





	ehh


		idk though 



						im still thinking about it

		i think i just found a resolution to 

			the fact that i want:

				1. edits in my editor to be quick, and using the anchor isnt really quick 

				2. using the anchor as i have it right now, is bad because 
					you can accidently delete the file because anchor is zero to start with. not good. i hate that. 

				3. i want to use the most recent value that the cursor has. 

					


			yeah, that will be good. 


			i found the way i want to do it. 

			basically, instead of    anchor    setting the current position to the anchor, 


				it just toggles whether the anchor follows the cursor!

					thats going to be the way i do it


						or wait



								WAIT





					NO



						oh my gosh!!!



								we literally can just




						we can just make              THE ANCHOR



									BE 



							THE RECENT





					like, we we dont care about the anchors value, 


							then we 




						okay this is the right way to implement this


						yayyy
								i found it 



					i love this 





							so basically, we make the anchor    be used as the recent 


				MOST OF THE TIME



					but then 



							when ever you press    anchor()


								then now, we are NOT following the cursor    (or i guess, always lagging behind, because thats how recent is supposed to work)


					(usually we lag behind! in "non anchor mode"



						)        	and then when we want to drop our anchor down, 



										and stop lagging behind, 



									we say          anchor()'



									and that changes the state of the system 

										to be NOT changing lal lac   every single command

								but actually just 


			

	
						yeah i know that this is the right way to do this, now,  i think 

						it is just ergonomic,  safe,  and simple.



						very cool  very cool 




					but just implementing it is rather hard... hmmm....


					not sure how to do it
