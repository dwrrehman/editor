this works pretty well as a text editor, shockingly.
like, its actually really shocking lol. like, all this just kinda came together instantly lol.
i really like it so far! 

i think i have some really good ways to try to mitigate the amount of origin switching we will need to do!
firstly, i want to have a command to make the cursor the origin, basically. that will ease some stuff, 

secondly, i want to have a really good find-forwards/backwards system. i am going to try implementing that now, i think. because thats really important. yay. gosh i actually love how useable this already is lol. its actually kinda ridiculous. yay.


also, just for some testing, heres some unicode characters! lets try doing âˆ‘, which seemed to work okay, 

	displaying them is actually totally fine lol. its just the act of moving the cursor over them that is odd. but honstely, i am tempted to just say that is working as intended lol. like, its such a small tiny little detail lol. i basically rarelyyyyy use unicode. but its nice that it works this well already lol. gosh this is so cool lol. okay.



okay, so this works great for small files, but we need to try displaying LONG text files, and see how it acts. thats the tricky part.  hm.. yeah.

	anyways, lets try doing that now lol. yay.
