		like, we still get all the functionality we need lol. its just not as... easy to use lol. it can be very slow lol. but it is quite safe though. 

		so yeah, thats actually okay i think. its good. yay.

			// the undo tree system isnt even something that i really use that often, either lol.
			// okay cool. now lets tidy up the code a ton!!!! thats probably smart lol. yay
