hello there, 
this is my cool thingy lol.

	okay, so it finally seems like i figured it out lol. nice. lol... yay! okay now, i want to see what it looks like for the border to get maxed out when we make a line that is too long lol. it seems like its doing okay so far lol. hmm. okay cool lol. yay. hello there from space lol.




okay, now i am going to try to make tis thing generate a text file!

	nice! okay,i think it did acutally! wow!

'		i think this is working quite well actually!

		its really seemless. you don't even really know that its happening lol. i like it alot. yay! so cool actuallyyyyyyyy wow lol.




okay

now


we are going to 




start 
yyyyy
typing after
aht
the page
break
and we are 
going to
see if we
can reach
the hello
to there from space. nice.
hello nice. yay.
okay cool. okay, so it seems like 
typing text actually does work at the end
of the document, its just... it doesnt quiteeee work
because like, we still have one more line to go, basically.
or like, the origin doesnt shift when we press enter, basically.
its kinda stupid lol. i feel like there should be an easy fix to this. we are 
implementing it in a really cool way though lol. yay. 
i really like this version of the editor though. its literally so cool. yay! very happy with it. 









yeah, typing actual characers always fixes it, but its definitely something that i need tofix though. anyways. 
lets solve this problem later i think lol. yay.
