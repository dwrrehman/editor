	now, lets actually paste what we just copied: working pretty well

		yes!! that actually worked. holy cow. lets now go bigger. multiline.

i am basically testing out my
new editor features, such as set, copy, paste, and delete.
they seem to be working pretty well...

	

		now lets do a backwards multiline copy paste:

			
hello there from space, this is the end of the file. hello there from space. 




		so yeah, i i think my editor has amazing controls now: 



	i  gave it the following controls:

		jio;      movement by one character
		
		JIO:	  jump movement:  begin, bottom, top, end,  respectively,

		kl	  word movement:   word left, and word right.    




	i think thats the correct placing, honestly.


		i really like it actually. now just to get used to it, lol.
		thats the hard part.  it makes alot of sense, though. lauren will find it intuitive. 


		whenever i show her my editor, that is, lol


	i dont know when that will be... 



but owell
