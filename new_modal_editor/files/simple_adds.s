this is a test of the clipboard writing functionality.
i am writing a small paragraph to copy to my cb, and
then put onto the task board, to write out using the
"write" command using f. lets see if it works!!




hi! i am writing this on 1202406252.021734 in order to test the editors new quit keybindings, which is actually only in the command system now. basically to prevent accidently quitting the editor, after you had cut something loll. so yeah.
