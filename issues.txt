currrent outstanding issues in the editor:
===========================================





BUGS:
=============


we accidenitly put a null character at the end of the text. we need to stop before that in order to write the file.

i think we are simply writing source_length, instead of the crrect source_length minus one.

we dont deal with tabs correctly.
we dont deal with unicode correctly.


FEATURES:
=============


- we arent displaying line numbers. 
	---> make this an option, or function. (line numbers)












note:


    once we deal with unicode characters,
    and once we get tabs to display properly,
    and once we fix the jump_bottom and max-downarrow functionality,
    
    
    
    
    
                        i think our editor is ready to use, for real.
