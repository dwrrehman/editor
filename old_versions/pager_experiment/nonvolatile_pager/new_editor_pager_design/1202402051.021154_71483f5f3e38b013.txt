hello there from space!

	this is my new text document lol. i don't really know how it works, 

		but it seems to work pretty well so far lol. lets if saving works lol.


	lets add some more text to this document! just to see if we can actually write text the way we want using this lol.
	its actually shockingly usable! i am liking it more and more the more i use it, which is quite cool.


i really want to try writing code with this though. thats the real test.


char* toreplace = strndup(text + anchor, cursor - anchor);
const nat toreplace_count = cursor - bubbles;
for (nat i = 0; i < toreplace_count; i++) delete();

cursor = selection_begin;
for (nat i = 0; i < selection_count; i++) delete();    // delete the current selection from a find call.

// insert a series of characters equal to the current string. 

for (nat i = 0; i < toreplace_count; i++) {
	insert(toreplace[i]);
}

printf("\033[7mreplaced at %llu, deleted %llu inserted %llu\033[0m\n", 
	selection_begin, selection_count, toreplace_count
);

int main(int argc, char** argv) {

	printf("%d: argv[0]: %s\n", argc, argv[0]);
	exit(0);
}
