		we just need to figure out a way to be able to input capital letters, lol. ands we need to fix the move up and move down functions lol. 

				those are literally the only two things that we have to do, in order to make the editor like genuinely usable, i think. 

				pretty amazing, if you ask me. 

					i love this, so much.
