yayyyy that worked!!!


todo: 
	- allow for arguments for the execute command, and insert command       (i think this already does?)


x	- make the working directory default for the location of a new file.


x	-  test using the new and create commands one after another. lets trythat now, actually. 



	- allow the creation of a new buffer, from an existing one, without actually invoking the editor again, or quitting it!!!!



x	- make    dt     a keybind. bind it to     a-d      ie,    d    when in state == 1.
