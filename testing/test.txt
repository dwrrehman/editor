wowowowowowowowoowowow



okay lol





hello there from space. 


tbh, i really dont think i need a hello there cursor.


i mean, i have a rudimentary version of it, using a space, as a cursor. i think its good enough!


i dont know. another way to do this, is simply to color the character that you are on. that might also work. ill think of that.
