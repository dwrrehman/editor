hello!



so i just quashed a bug, and also tried to get whitespace trimming to work, only to realize that i actually dont want to trim the white space. 


	so yeah



hmm, okay, so it also seems like wwe have another rendering bug- the cursor gets desynced when wrap text.  yiks..


and it only gets worse and worse lol







okay actually i just fixed it. it was a super easy fix. it was just because of line numbers, basically.




	oh but actually, i just found another rendering bug!


	it has to do with the cursor desyncing slihglty when we are moving along because of the scrolling feature of this editor. 


		gosh, scrolling and wrapping are SUPER hard, for some reason, lol


also we still have the cursor dessync from the tabs not being properly done lol



that will be fixed at some point. lol
