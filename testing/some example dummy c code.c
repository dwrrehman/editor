	// i am quite hopeful that this editor will actually work out, and it will be the editor that i actually use full time from now on. i have to start using it, for coding at least. i think i am going to try to use it for some leetcode challenges. lets try that now. lol. yay. this is pretty cool. yayy. then i want to try writing a text document using i too lol. yay. one step at a time though. time for some leetcode! yay. 



// i don't know if this works, but i guess we will see lol. yay. lets also add the global clipboard paste, actually, lets see if that works lol. yay.
