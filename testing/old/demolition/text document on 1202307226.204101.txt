this is a new text document, that i am writing using my own editor. 
it is working really well so far, with no bugs whatsoever. i am quite impressed. 
what do you think about it? is it easy to use? kinda. i think all the 
commands are kinda backwards, but i like it like that. lol. 

so yeah. also that datetime at the top was autogenerated by the editor itself!
so thats nifty. yay.

anyways, gunna try to save this document now. crossing my fingers, very hard, lol. 
wish we luck.

oh my gosh it actually worked! i was able to save the current file by executing the following commands:

```
	location .
	name text document name here.txt
	create
```

that created the file, and named it that stuff. so thats so cool. i want the location to default to ".", 
though, definitely lol. anyways. easy fix. 

anyways, i think i am going to save this, and then try to open another file, now. because thats 
an important use case too lol. yay. 

lets try doing that now.
