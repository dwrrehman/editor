It had been a late night. To be more correct, it had been an early morning. It was now 3:00 AM and George was just getting home. He wasn't sure if it had been worth it.

As the mother bear took another step forward with her cubs in tow, she knew her fist with keys wasn't going to be an adequate defense for this situation.
"Do Not Enter." The sign made it clear that they didn't want anyone around. That wasn't going to stop Jack.
