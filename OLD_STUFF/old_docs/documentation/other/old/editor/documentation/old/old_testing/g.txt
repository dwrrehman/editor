hello there from space. 
this is my really good file, with lots of good stuff.

im trying to figure out the best way to implement some stuff.. its still a work in progress, but im making really good progress... hello there from space!





ok i think our up and down work perfectly, now!


yay.


im really happy with everything.



it would be nice to have a custimizable background color and font color for this editor..


i dont think it woul dbe that hard...



but anyways, lets save that for another time.



i kinda like how this turnign now, now!


everything fits together really well,















hello, i am really happy with my editor.



      this is litearlly an Editor that i made myself, and im testing it by typing in this document!


      its reallly cool.

                  i think that i like spaces alot more than tabs,



                 but none the less, i want to be able to cope with tabs, well.



                and even display them properly.



                           




                i think that its possible.         i just need to work at it.

                all the code seems to work flawlessly so far....            i think that we are almost ready for prime time.
















i really like this text editor. it is just as minimalist as i wanted it to be.
im really happy with it.
