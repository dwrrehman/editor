YAYYYYY i was able to create a new file, from the current one, just by doing 

```
	i u i l r           // this deletes the current file contents.     (move top, move bottom, cut)

	t new r h r a t          // this issues the create new command, which names it something unique.

	t create r h r a t      //   this creates the new file, saving it. 
```


so yeah, this seems to work really well actually! i am quiteeeee happy with how this whole thing is working so far. 

	now, i want to do stuff that is devious. 



		i want to tryto make the system overwrite a file that i had made,  in this directory, 


							"by accident"     lol

		i don't know what is going to happen

		but i am going to try really hard to make do that lol. 


				lets see if we are successful in that. 










i honestly don't know if we are going to be 


	but its worth a shot lol. 




anyways. lets try it.
