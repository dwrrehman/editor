------------------- bugs in the "wef" editor ----------------



[!]	- the cursor still gets desynced from where the text is being inserted, 
		usually only by one character. 
		it happens when using tabs, and wrap around from the wrap width.



[!]	- i think this still crashes, i think. 

		we need to make this thing more stable. we need to make sure that we 
		NEVER EVER seg fault. thats super important.

			ie, we need to do a range bounds check on literally everything.
			thats probably the only way we can prevent against that, tbh. 
			im not sure how we could, otherwise.

	
		
[!]	- when wrapping around text, we dont handle it properly, yet. 
		seriously have to work on this. get it right.



[!]	- we are handling down and up arrows incorrectly, when it comes to tabs. 
		we need to account for the width of characters, when going downards, 
		not the number of characters. ie, we need to know how far into the screen 
		we are, ie, not the line length, i think.
